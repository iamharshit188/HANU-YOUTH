# ðŸŽ‰ Errors Fixed and AI Enhanced - Complete Summary

## âœ… All Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Research Functionality Error âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Research API was failing with "Research Failed Unable to complete research" error.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between component sending `query` and API expecting `prompt`.

**Solution**:
- Fixed API call in `AIResearchAssistant.tsx` to send `prompt` instead of `query`
- Updated response handling to work with the API response format
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Research now works seamlessly with mock data for static export

### 2. Module Loading Error (447.js) âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Runtime error "Error: Cannot find module './447.js'" during development.

**Root Cause**: Webpack configuration issues with static export and missing fallbacks for Node.js modules.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `next.config.ts` with comprehensive webpack configuration
- Added fallback configurations for Node.js modules (fs, net, tls, crypto, etc.)
- Enabled top-level await for dynamic imports
- Added proper static export configuration with output directory

### 3. Site Not Found Errors âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: "Site not found" errors on certain routes and broken links.

**Root Cause**: Missing route handling and improper static export configuration.

**Solution**:
- Verified all routes are properly configured
- Updated `netlify.toml` with correct publish directory (`out`)
- Added proper redirect rules for SPA functionality
- Ensured all pages are correctly generated during build
